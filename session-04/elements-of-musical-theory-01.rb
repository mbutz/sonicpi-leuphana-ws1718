  # A scale usually consists of half and whole (or two half) tone steps.
  # For the major scale applies the following structure:
  # c - 1 - d - 1 - e  - 1/2 f - 1 - g - 1 - a - 1 -  b - 1/2 -  c

  play_pattern_timed scale(:c, :major), 1
  # sleep 2

  # The differentiating character of scales thus depends on
  # 1. How many tones the scale has (usually 7)
  # 2. The distribution of half and whole tone steps

  # A minor scale could e.g. look like this:
  # c - 1 - d - 1/2 - eb - 1 - f - 1 - g - 1/2 - ab - 1 - bb - 1 - c

  #play_pattern_timed scale(:c, :aeolian), 1
  #sleep 2

end #comment

  # To make things even more complicated:
# There are several major and minor scales and some where it is not
# quite clear whether they are major or minor.

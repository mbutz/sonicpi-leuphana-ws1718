  # Intervalls are the corner stones of chords; especially the
  # third; to call a bunch of tones a chord there must be at
  # least one third (or its inversion: a sixth). Usually chords
  # are build of two ore more thirds.

  # A succession of fiths:

  play [:c4, :g4], sustain: 2, release: 1
  sleep 2
  play [:f4, :c5], sustain: 2, release: 1
  sleep 2
  play [:g4, :d5], sustain: 2, release: 1

end

  # Add a note between these two notes and you will get
  # two thirds - one build over the other.

  # The above played chords have the structure:
  # Bass tone - major third - minor third
  # This makes all of them major chords.

  # A chord does 1. not necessarily have to have two thirds and 2. can
  # have more than three notes. These are the reasons, why you'll find

    # Let's invert some of the chords to make the melodic flow more smoothly'
    # 'Inversion' means move the base chord tone to the top; with a triad you
    # can do this two times until the chord has its original shape again.
    # What's happening here is, that you optimise the melodic flow of the notes;
    # You create 'voicings' and move the notes more smoothly than without inversions.
